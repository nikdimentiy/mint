def solution(s1, s2):
    """
    Compare two strings based on their tokenized representation.

    The function tokenizes both input strings, where tokens can be either
    integers or individual characters. It returns True if the tokenized
    representation of s1 is less than that of s2, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        s1 (str): The first string to compare.
        s2 (str): The second string to compare.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the tokenized representation of s1 is less than that of s2, False otherwise.

def tokenize(s):
    """
    Tokenize the input string into a list of tokens and their lengths.

    The function uses regular expressions to find all sequences of digits
    and individual characters. It returns a tuple containing:
    1. A list of tuples where each tuple consists of a type indicator (0 for integers, 1 for characters)
       and the token itself.
    2. A list of negative lengths of the tokens for sorting purposes.

    Args:
        s (str): The string to tokenize.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the list of tokens and the list of negative lengths.
