def solution(f, k):

    Rotate specific elements of a 2D list (matrix) `f` a number of times based on `k`.
    
    The function performs a series of swaps on the elements of the matrix `f` for `k % 6` iterations.
    The specific elements that are swapped are determined by their positions in the matrix.
    
    Parameters:
    f (list of list of int): A 2D list (matrix) with at least 4 rows and 3 columns.
    k (int): The number of times to perform the rotation, which is reduced modulo 6.
    
    Returns:
    list of list of int: The modified 2D list after performing the rotations.
