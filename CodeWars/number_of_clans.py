def solution(divisors, k):
    """
    Calculate the number of clans formed by integers from 1 to k based on their divisibility by a given set of divisors.

    Two integers A and B are considered friends if each integer from the array 'divisors' is either a divisor of both A and B or neither A nor B.
    If two integers are friends, they belong to the same clan.

    Parameters:
    divisors (list of int): A list of integers that are used as divisors to determine friendships.
    k (int): The upper limit of integers to consider (from 1 to k).

    Returns:
    int: The number of distinct clans formed by the integers from 1 to k.
