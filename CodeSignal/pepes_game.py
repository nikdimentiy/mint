    """
    This function calculates the minimum number of cells that can be reached in a grid 
    based on specific movement rules defined by the characters in the grid. The grid 
    consists of characters representing walls, open paths, and targets. The function 
    uses depth-first search (DFS) to explore the grid and determine reachable cells.

    Parameters:
    state (list of list of str): A 2D grid represented as a list of lists, where each 
                                  element is a string representing a cell in the grid.

    Returns:
    int: The number of reachable cells minus the number of targets, or a negative value 
         indicating failure to reach certain targets.
