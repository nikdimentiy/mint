def solution(votes, k):
    """
    Determines the number of candidates who can still win the election 
    after considering additional votes.

    Parameters:
    votes (list of int): A list where each element represents the number of votes a candidate has.
    k (int): The number of additional votes available to be distributed.

    Returns:
    int: The number of candidates who can potentially win the election 
         if they receive the additional votes. If `k` is 0, it returns:
         - 1 if there is exactly one candidate with the maximum votes.
         - 0 if there are multiple candidates with the maximum votes.
