def wordsindict(dictionary, text):
    """
    Check if words in a given list are 'good words' based on a dictionary.

    This function takes a list of 'good words' (dictionary) and a list of words to check (text).
    It determines if each word in the text is a 'good word' or not based on the dictionary.

    Parameters:
        dictionary (list): A list of strings representing 'good words'.
        text (list): A list of strings representing the words to be checked.

    Returns:
        list: A list of boolean values where each element represents whether the corresponding word in the text is a 'good word' or not.

    Example:
        dictionary = ["cat", "dog", "fish"]  # List of 'good words'
        text = ["cat", "bat", "dog", "dish"]  # List of words to check
        result = wordsindict(dictionary, text)
        # result will be [True, False, True, False] as "cat" and "dog" are present in the dictionary,
        # while "bat" and "dish" are not.

    Note:
        A 'good word' is defined as a word that exists in the dictionary or can be formed by removing a single letter from a word in the dictionary.
