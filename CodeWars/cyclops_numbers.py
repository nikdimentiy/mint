    Determine if a given positive integer n is a cyclops number when converted to binary.

    A cyclops number in binary is defined as a number that consists of all 1's with exactly one 0 
    in the middle position. This means the binary representation must have an odd number of digits.

    Parameters:
    n (int): A positive integer to be checked.

    Returns:
    bool: True if n is a cyclops number in binary, False otherwise.
