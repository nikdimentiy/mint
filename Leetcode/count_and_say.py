class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        """Returns the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

        The count-and-say sequence is a series of strings where each term is obtained by reading the previous term and counting the number of consecutive digits. For example, the first few terms are:

        1
        11
        21
        1211
        111221
        ...

        Args:
            n: An integer representing the position of the term in the sequence.

        Returns:
            A string representing the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.
