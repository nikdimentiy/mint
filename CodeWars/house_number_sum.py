# A boy is walking a long way from school to his home.
# To make the walk more fun he decides to add up all the numbers of the houses that he passes by during his walk.
# Unfortunately, not all of the houses have numbers written on them,
# and on top of that the boy is regularly taking turns to change streets, so the numbers don't appear to him in any particular order.

# At some point during the walk the boy encounters a house with number 0 written on it,
# which surprises him so much that he stops adding numbers to his total right after seeing that house.

# For the given sequence of houses determine the sum that the boy will get.
# It is guaranteed that there will always be at least one 0 house on the path.
