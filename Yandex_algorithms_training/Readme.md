# Algorithm Concepts and Data Structures

## Complexity, Testing, Special Cases 🧠

**Algorithm Complexity**: Estimation of the resources (time, memory) required to execute an algorithm depending on the input data size.

**Testing**: Checking the correctness of a program with various sets of input data.

**Special Cases**: Handling specific cases in algorithms that may require a unique approach.

## Dictionaries and Counting Sort 📚

**Dictionaries (Hash Tables)**: A data structure that stores key-value pairs, providing quick access to values by key.

**Counting Sort**: An efficient sorting algorithm based on counting the occurrences of each element.

## Prefix Sums and Two Pointers ➕➖

**Prefix Sums**: An array where each element represents the sum of elements of the original array up to the current position.

**Two Pointers**: A technique for solving problems using two pointers to efficiently process arrays or lists.
