# Algorithms and Data Structures Overview

## 1. Complexity, Testing, Special Cases 🧐

Algorithm complexity is a measure of its efficiency and the dependence of execution time on the size of input data. It allows us to assess how fast or slow an algorithm works as the size of input data increases.

Algorithm testing is the process of checking its correctness and efficiency. Various input data, including special cases, are used during algorithm testing to ensure that the algorithm works correctly in all situations.

## 2. Linear Search 🔍

Linear search is a simple algorithm for finding an element in an array or list. It sequentially checks each element of the input data until it finds the desired element or traverses the entire array. Linear search has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

## 3. Sets 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

A set is a data structure that contains unique elements without a specific order. In the Python programming language, sets are represented by the data type 'set.' Sets support operations such as adding, removing, and checking for the existence of an element. They also support set union, intersection, and difference operations.

## 4. Dictionaries and Counting Sort 📚

A dictionary is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. In the Python programming language, dictionaries are represented by the data type 'dict.' Dictionaries allow for quickly finding a value by its key and support operations such as adding, removing, and updating elements.

Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that counts the occurrences of each element in an array and then constructs a sorted array based on these counts. Counting sort is efficient when the range of element values is limited and known in advance.

## 5. Prefix Sums and Two Pointers ➕👉👈

Prefix sums are a technique that allows for efficiently calculating the sum of elements at the prefix (beginning) of an array. Prefix sums can be useful when solving problems related to calculating the sum of elements in a subarray or finding a subarray with the maximum sum.

Two pointers are a technique that uses two pointers, typically the start and end of an array, to efficiently solve problems. It is often applied when working with sorted arrays or lists. Two pointers can be used to find a pair of elements with a specific property or to find a subarray with a specific sum.

## 6. Binary Search 🔍🔢

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array or list. It works by dividing the array in half and comparing the desired element with the element in the middle. If the desired element is smaller, the search continues in the left half; if larger, the search continues in the right half. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

## 7. Event Sorting 📅🔄

Event sorting is a technique used for efficiently processing and sorting events or intervals. It is based on representing events or intervals as points on the time axis and subsequently sorting them. Event sorting can be helpful when solving problems related to processing time intervals, event overlaps, or finding the most frequently occurring intervals.

## 8. Trees 🌳

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes and edges. Each node can have multiple child nodes but only one parent node. Trees are widely used in programming to represent hierarchical relationships, such as a file system, the structure of an HTML document, or the organizational structure of a company. Trees are also used in algorithms like depth-first search and breadth-first search.
